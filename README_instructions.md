# Aardvark Compare Technical Test

Thanks for applying to work at AardvarkCompare.com. We have developed this small task for you to work on in your own time so that we can see how you approach tasks and as a discussion point going forwards.

Try to spend less than two hours on this task - and don't worry if it is not complete, we prefer to see quality over quantity.

Please implement the task however you like, but please use React.

## The task

Using the Punk Beer API, build a front-end application that presents a list of beers to the user, with associated images. The design and amount of information to display is completely up to you.

- Display a list of beer, with images (as a minimum)

**Bonus task(s)**

- Add the ability to sort by name, strength etc.
- Can each beer have its own page when clicked?
- Add unit tests

### Notes

- Please create documentation for the steps required to run the project.
- Punk API can be found here - https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2
